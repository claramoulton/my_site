    <p1 id="about">
      Clara has a passion for creativity, social and environmental justice, people, and place. They have spent 15+ years working in non-profits and federal land managment agencies, leading dynamic teams working to transform barriers, biases, and gaps in policies and practices, while implementing conservation projects on public and private lands.
      Clara was born and raised in Montana where they first developed a love for wild places. After living in Utah, Wisconsin, and Washington, they've settled in the four corners region of Colorado and are proud to call the San Juan Mountains home. Clara graduated from The University of Montana with a B.S. in Geography and minors in Wilderness Studies, Mountain Studies, and Internaional Development Studies. When not working on building their coding knowledge with Fullstack Academy's Coding Bootcamp, you can find them renovating their 1903 home with their partner, adventuring with their wild pups via foot, bike, raft, and ski, fermenting foods and beverages, or curled up with their cats reading a good book.
